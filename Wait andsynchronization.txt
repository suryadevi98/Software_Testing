  wait or synchronization   
  =======================


  Implicit wait  - Global wait
  =============

     * It will tell to the webdriver to wait for a certine time.

     * before throwing no such element exception.
 
     * An implicit wait sets a default wait time for the entire life of the WebDriver instance. If a web element is not immediately available, the WebDriver will 
  wait up to the specified time before throwing a NoSuchElementException.

 
 Syntax
 ======

  driver.manage().timeouts.implicitlywait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  -> 3.141

  driver.manage().timeouts.implicitlywait(Duration, ofseconds(30)); -> 4.1


 Explicit wait
 =============
   
   *  It will tell to the webdriver to wait for a cenrtain conditions (or) maximum time before, throwing Element not visible exceptions.
   *  Explicit waits allow you to define a specific condition to wait for. You can use them to wait for a particular condition to be true before proceeding. 
 This is often used for waiting for elements to be clickable, visible, or present.

 Syntax
 ======
   
   //class

    
     WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait (driver,30);

     Wait.until(ExpectedCondiions.VisibilityOf(webelement)); -> 3.141

     WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver.Duration.Ofnanos(20));

     Wait.until(ExpectedCondition.VisibilityOf(drop)); -> 4.1.1


 Fluent Wait
 ===========
 
     * It will tell to the WebDriver to wait for a condition as well a Frequency.
     
     * Extends explicit waits with additional options for polling and exception handling.

       Frequency -> Reqular interval of time.

 Syntax
 ======

    wait wait1 = new Fluentwait(driver).withtimeout(30,Timeunit.SECONDS).pollingEvery(s, Timeunit.SECONDS).ignoring(Exception class);


 Differences
 ===========

    Implicit wait                                 Explicit wait                           
    =============                                 =============

 Applicable for all elements                   Applicable for only that particular Element

 no specific conditions                        separate conditions

thread.sleep - static  - milli second
